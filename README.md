## Description
The Ping Pong Ball Game is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball. The objective is to keep the ball in play and score points by hitting it with the paddle. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the ball's speed increases with each level.

The game ends when the ball falls past the paddle, resulting in a "Game Over." Afterward, the player can choose to replay the game or exit.
